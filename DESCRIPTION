Description: General purpose software package, written in C, that solves non-linear systems of equations of the form F(x, p) = 0
             where F is a vector-valued function of a vector x of unknowns and p represents a parameter. There is little limitation 
             to the formulation of the system of equations, for example, F(x, p) may be defined as the result of an numerical 
             integration of a system of ordinary differential equations. For this purpose the package also includes a  dedicated
             numerical differential equation solver. When a solution point x to the system of equations has been found, the package 
             will output all information about the solution point itself and all the values of additional functions G(x) 
             that the user can define his/herself. Here again, G(x) is a vector-valued function.
